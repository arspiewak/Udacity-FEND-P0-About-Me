# Udacity-FEND-P0-About-Me
Warmup project for the Udacity Front-End Nanodegree, a simple about-me HTML page with style sheet.

Two files are included: index.html and styles.css. They expect to be located in the same directory.
All images and other resources (e.g. fonts) are referenced by hyperlink. The files are adapted from
the Udacity project files for this assignment, downloaded in Step 1 of the "P0: About Me" module.
